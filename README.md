# hello-world
This is a good chance for me to learn more!Let's go!!

I am a person who wants to know more about CS and data analysis with Python.

But I have a bad habit which is that I can not insist to do something for a long time.

This time when I signed in GitHub,I told myself that I will try my best to change this bad habit.

I trust myself and I believe a old slang that if you keep trying to do something,you will finally succeed!

Now I will keeping using this wonderful network platform,I want to be better!

Just do it!!!
